# Round-Robin-CPU-scheduling
Python implementation of the Round Robin CPU scheduling algorithm

## Getting Started

To access the code in this repo, first clone it in your machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/GamboaDd27/Round-Robin-CPU-scheduling
```

### Prerequisites

The only prerequisite is python 3. You can get it from here:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Windows/Mac/Linus


### Running the program

Once you've cloned this repo, change directory into it

```
cd Round-Robin-CPU-scheduling
```

To run the program, a csv file containing data for Process ID, Arrival Time and Burst Time is required as an argument. Additionally,
a time quatum in ms is required as a second parameter.

The following command runs the simulation script in a file named file.csv with a time quantum of 2

```
python run.py file.csv 2
```
